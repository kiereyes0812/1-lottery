                <p>At <a href="https://1lotteryy.io/">1 Lottery</a> Game, we believe gaming should always be a source of fun and relaxation. It should never
                    harm your life, health, or relationships. Responsible Gaming means playing in a safe, balanced, and
                    mindful way. This page explains how we support our players and how you can enjoy gaming without
                    losing control.</p>
                <p>Responsible Gaming at 1 Lottery Game means playing for enjoyment while staying in control. Games are
                    meant to be light, fun, and safe, not stressful or harmful.</p>

            <div class="section inner-section">
                <h2>What is Responsible Gaming</h2>
                <p> Responsible Gaming simply means knowing
                    your limits. It is about playing in moderation, keeping control over your time and money, and
                    knowing when to stop and take a break.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section inner-section">
                <h2>Why Responsible Gaming Matters</h2>

                    balance gaming with other parts of life. But unhealthy play can lead to problems like overspending
                    money, playing for very long hours, stress and frustration, or ignoring school, work, and family.
